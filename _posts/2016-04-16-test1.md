One of the things that got me to use **Jekyll**, a static site generator, was that I could easily build my blog on GitHubPages, customize URLs, host source code on GitHub and deploy it to the cloud. I also wanted to build a **Jekyll** blog and host it on Azure Web Apps. The problem encountered, however is that **Jekyll** is based on Ruby and by default, `Azure App Service` does not support it.

Let's start deploying **Jekyll** to `Azure App Service` (Web app). I will assume you already have your **Jekyll** blog running locally and your repository on GitHub. If you don't, follow [Jekyll's getting started guide](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/).
